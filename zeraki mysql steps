zeraki MYSQL test.

Step one.

First create the Institution table. 

CREATE TABLE institution (
    institutionid int(11),
    name varchar(250),
    PRIMARY KEY (institutionid)
 );


second create the course table.

CREATE TABLE course (
    courseid int(11),
    name varchar(250),
    institution int(11),
    PRIMARY KEY (courseid),
    FOREIGN KEY (institution) REFERENCES institution(institutionid)
);


Then finaly create the student table.



CREATE TABLE student (
    studentid int(11),
    name varchar(250),
   course int(11),
 PRIMARY KEY (studentid),
FOREIGN KEY (course) REFERENCES course(courseid)
 );



For the second part, this is a qiery that would retvive number of students percourse per institution. 



SELECT i.name as INSTITUTION_NAME, 
MAX(c.name) AS COURSE_NAME, 
COUNT(s.studentid) AS NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS
    FROM course c
    LEFT JOIN student s ON s.course = c.courseid
    LEFT JOIN institution i 
	ON i.institutionid = c.institution
    GROUP BY c.courseid;
